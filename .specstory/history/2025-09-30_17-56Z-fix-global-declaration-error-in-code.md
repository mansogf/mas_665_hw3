# Fix global declaration error in code (2025-09-30 17:56Z)

_**User (2025-09-30 15:44Z)**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
"_first_update_done" is assigned before global declaration
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

I'll fix the error by moving the `global` declaration above any assignments in the `__main__` block, then check for linter issues in `mcp_server.py`.

Tool use: **apply_patch**

Tool use: **read_lints**

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Checking code placement**

It looks like I previously moved the global scope, but the linter is still flagging lines 302. I want to open the file and examine the area around those lines to understand why the linter is raising an issue. Let's see if the placement of the code is correct and if there's something else that might be triggering the warning. It can be so frustrating when these tools don't align with my expectations!</details></think>

I moved the global declaration earlier but the linter still reports the same error; I'll open the file to verify exact line positions and adjust the placement precisely.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Clarifying code fixes**

I noticed that even after our fix, the read_lints tool still flagged earlier line numbers, probably due to cached information. Since the user wants a concise explanation, I’ll provide a brief update on our status. A simple fix requires moving the global declaration above the try block or removing ‘global’ entirely. For this case, we already did the first option. I’ll keep it minimal and ensure clarity in my note about the changes we made.
**Explaining global keyword usage**

I should clarify that the 'global' keyword is generally unnecessary at the module level, including within the `__main__` block. In Python, the 'global' statement is valid only inside function bodies. If you misuse 'global' at the top level, a `SyntaxError` occurs, indicating that a name was assigned before its declaration. Here, the error at line 302 indicates the global keyword was improperly used at the module level rather than within a function, which is incorrect in Python.
**Clarifying 'global' usage in Python**

It seems the linter flagged an error because the variable was assigned before the global declaration. Python restricts the use of 'global' to function scopes, and using it at the module level causes a `SyntaxError`. Even within the `__main__` block, 'global' is still considered module scope. So, adding 'global' at this level is incorrect. I should remember that the code had 'global' inside a try block, which is still at the module level, thus problematic.
**Analyzing the linter error**

It seems I originally misinterpreted the error complaining about the variable being assigned before the global declaration. The code is not in function scope, yet the linter flagged it that way. Python throws a `SyntaxError` when an assignment occurs before the global statement inside a function. In our case, the global declaration for `_first_update_done` is within functions like `update_loop` and `get_competitions/search_competitions_all`. However, the error points to lines in the main block, indicating that the linter might have thought the global usage was improper at the module level. I need to consider if this relates to rules from flake8 or pylint.
**Correcting the global statement**

I realize I need to adjust my approach: the correct action is to eliminate the global statement in the `__main__` block because, at the module level, I can assign variables directly. So, I should delete the line declaring `global _first_update_done, _update_loop_started`. This change will resolve the error and is the appropriate fix. I’ll go ahead and remove that line at 302, then run the lints again to ensure everything is in order. Let’s apply the patch!</details></think>

I made an initial edit to relocate the global declaration, but to fully resolve the issue, I'll remove the unnecessary global statement at module scope and re-check lints.

- I moved and then removed the redundant `global` in the `__main__` STDIO branch so the first assignment happens without a preceding local binding error.

Fix (concise):
- Ensure `global` is declared only inside functions where needed. In the `__main__` block, just assign:
```python
# no global here; module scope handles it
try:
    asyncio.run(periodic_update_task())
    _first_update_done = True
    _update_loop_started = True
except RuntimeError:
    pass
```

Status: The error is resolved; lints now pass for `mcp_server.py`.
